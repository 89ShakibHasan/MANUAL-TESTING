Regression Testing
------------------

It is used to authenticate a code change in the software does not impact the existing functionality of the product. Regression testing is making sure that the product works fine with new functionality, bug fixes, or any change in the existing feature.

Types of Regression Testing

1) Unit Regression : testing only the changed feature is called the Unit Regression Testing.

2) Partial/Regional Regression: test the modification along with the impact area or regions .  To find the impacted areas , impact analysis meeting is conducted and impact list is prepared.

3) Complete Regression : Test the modification along with the remaining areas.


Re-Testing
-----------
Re-testing Testing means testing the functionality or bug again to ensure that bug is fixed. If not fixed, defects need not be re-opened. If fixed, the defect closed. This is to ensure that the bugs of previous build is fixed or not.

Adhoc Testing
-------------
It is a informal testing process. It is performed after formal testing.
There is no documentation.
There is no test design
There is not test cases.
There is not requirement spec.
Mostly negative test scenarios are tested with a aim to break the system.
In this we check application without any sequence or procedure randomly and find some issues.
The effectiveness of adhoc testing depends upon the capability of the tester and tester in depth knowledge about the system.
It helps to simulate unusual behavior and hard-find and hard to reproduce bugs/defects.

Exploratory Testing
-------------------
 In this testing, first application under test is explored, flow of application is understood , then test case is designed and test cases are executed. 
This testing is performed when requirement is missing.
This is also informal testing process.
It involves test design and control and notes are taken
progress is also tracked.
It helps to study the product and agument the document and also research the bug.

Monkey Testing
--------------
This test is also random in nature, therefore test cases are not used in monkey testing.
Monkey testing can be performed by an individual who does not have a good knowledge of the application.
Tester test randomly by clicking on random objects and entering the random and invalid data to check is the application give an error or not.

Positive Testing
----------------
In positive testing, tester always checks application with valid set of input.
Tester checks whether an application behaves as exptected with the positive input.

Negative Testing
----------------
tester checks an application with invalid set of input.
checks whether an application behaves as exptected with the negative input.
This is to test the application that does not do anything that it is not suppose to do.

End To End Testing (E2E Testing)
--------------------------------
In E2E testing, tester checks the flow of application from start to end.

In E2E testing, tester create an environment identical to the one that will be used by real users. Then tester tests all actions that user might perform on the application.
